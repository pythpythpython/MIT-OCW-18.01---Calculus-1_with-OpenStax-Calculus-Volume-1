    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the fundamental concept of the derivative, one of the two central ideas in calculus (along with the integral). We explore how derivatives arise naturally from the geometric problem of finding tangent lines and the physical problem of calculating instantaneous velocity.\n",

    "## Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus was developed independently by **Isaac Newton (1643-1727)** and **Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716)** in the late 17th century. While both mathematicians deserve credit for their groundbreaking work, their approaches differed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Newton** focused on physics and motion, developing calculus to understand planetary motion and gravity\n",
    "- **Leibniz** approached calculus more geometrically and developed much of the notation we use today\n",
    "\n",
    "Both built upon earlier work by:\n",
    "- **Pierre de Fermat** (method of finding maxima and minima)\n",
    "- **Isaac Barrow** (geometric methods for tangents)\n",
    "- **Bonaventura Cavalieri** (method of indivisibles)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of Newton and Leibniz was recognizing the **fundamental relationship between differentiation and integration** - that they are inverse operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Key Concepts Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative measures **instantaneous rate of change**. Just as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The slope of a line measures how steeply it rises or falls\n",
    "- The velocity of an object measures how fast its position changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative $f'(a)$ measures how rapidly the function $f(x)$ changes at the point $x = a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Two Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric:** The derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical:** The derivative is the instantaneous velocity (rate of change of position with respect to time).\n",
    "\n",
    "These two perspectives are mathematically equivalent, united by the concept of **limit**.\n",
