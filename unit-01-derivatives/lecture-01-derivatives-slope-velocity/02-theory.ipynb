    "## 1. Tangent Lines and Secant Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secant Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "A **secant line** to a function $f$ is a line that intersects the graph of $f$ at two distinct points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two points $(a, f(a))$ and $(x, f(x))$ on the graph of $f$, the slope of the secant line through these points is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_{\\text{sec}} = \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **average rate of change** of $f$ over the interval $[a, x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tangent Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, a **tangent line** to a curve at a point $P$ is the line that \"just touches\" the curve at $P$ and has the same direction as the curve at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** As the second point moves closer to the first along the curve, the secant lines approach the tangent line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Limiting Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the tangent line at $(a, f(a))$ is obtained by taking the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the second point approaches $(a, f(a))$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_{\\text{tan}} = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$\n",

    "provided this limit exists.\n",

    "## 2. The Difference Quotient\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition 3.1 (Difference Quotient)**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let $f$ be a function defined on an interval $I$ containing $a$. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. If $x \\neq a$ is in $I$, then\n",
    ">    $$Q = \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$\n",
    ">    is a **difference quotient**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. If $h \\neq 0$ is chosen so that $a + h$ is in $I$, then\n",
    ">    $$Q = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$$\n",
    ">    is a **difference quotient with increment** $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Equivalent Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Both expressions measure the same thing - the average rate of change. The choice of which to use depends on convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Form 1** (using $x$): $\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$\n",
    "  - Useful when $x$ is specified directly\n",
    "  - Natural for geometric interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Form 2** (using $h$): $\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$\n",
    "  - Useful for algebraic manipulations\n",
    "  - $h$ represents the \"change\" in $x$\n",
    "  - As $h \\to 0$, we approach the point $a$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship:** Setting $x = a + h$ (or equivalently $h = x - a$) converts one form to the other.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition 3.2 (The Derivative at a Point)**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let $f$ be a function defined in an open interval containing $a$. The **derivative** of $f$ at $a$, denoted $f'(a)$, is defined by\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$f'(a) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \\tag{3.5}$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> provided this limit exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the limit exists, we say that $f$ is **differentiable** at $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative $f'(a)$ equals the **slope of the tangent line** to the graph of $y = f(x)$ at the point $(a, f(a))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "If $s(t)$ represents position at time $t$, then $s'(a)$ represents the **instantaneous velocity** at time $t = a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process of Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a derivative is called **differentiation**. To find $f'(a)$ using the definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write out the difference quotient: $\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$\n",
    "2. Simplify the numerator algebraically\n",
    "3. Cancel the factor $(x-a)$ from numerator and denominator\n",
    "4. Take the limit as $x \\to a$\n",

    "> **Definition 3.3 (Alternative Definition)**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Alternatively, we may define the derivative of $f$ at $a$ as\n",

    "### Notation for Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative can be expressed using various notations, each with its own advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lagrange's notation**: $f'(a)$ or $f'(x)$\n",
    "   - Simple and concise\n",
    "   - Clear which function is being differentiated\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Leibniz's notation**: $\\frac{df}{dx}$ or $\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n",
    "   - Emphasizes the ratio of infinitesimal changes\n",
    "   - Useful for manipulating differentials\n",
    "   - Common in physics and engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Newton's notation**: $\\dot{f}$ (for time derivatives)\n",
    "   - Used primarily in physics\n",
    "   - Indicates differentiation with respect to time\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Operator notation**: $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$ or $D_x f(x)$\n",
    "   - Treats differentiation as an operation\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Theorem 3.1**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let $f(x)$ be a function and $a$ be in its domain. If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $f$ is differentiable at $a$. Then $f'(a)$ exists and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(a) = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To show continuity at $a$, we must prove that $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) &= \\lim_{x \\to a} [f(x) - f(a) + f(a)] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\lim_{x \\to a} [f(x) - f(a)] + \\lim_{x \\to a} f(a) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\lim_{x \\to a} \\left[ \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \\cdot (x - a) \\right] + f(a) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\left( \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\lim_{x \\to a} (x - a) \\right) + f(a) \\\\\n",
    "&= f'(a) \\cdot 0 + f(a) \\\\\n",
    "&= f(a)\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",

    "## 7. When Derivatives Fail to Exist\n",
    "\n",
    "A function may fail to be differentiable at a point for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 1: Discontinuity\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f$ is not continuous at $a$, then $f$ is not differentiable at $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & x < 0 \\\\ x+1 & x \\geq 0 \\end{cases}$ is not continuous (hence not differentiable) at $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 2: Corner or Cusp\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left-hand and right-hand derivatives exist but are not equal, there is a \"corner\" or \"cusp.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x) = |x|$ is continuous but not differentiable at $x = 0$ because:\n",
    "- Left-hand derivative: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{-h}{h} = -1$\n",
    "- Right-hand derivative: $\\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{h}{h} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 3: Vertical Tangent\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tangent line is vertical, the derivative is undefined (slope would be infinite).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ has a vertical tangent at $x = 0$ because:\n",
    "$$f'(0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{h}}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{1}{h^{2/3}} = \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case 4: Oscillatory Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "If the function oscillates too wildly near the point, the limit may not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x\\sin(1/x) & x \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 & x = 0 \\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference quotient at $x=0$ is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \\frac{h\\sin(1/h)}{h} = \\sin(1/h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This oscillates between $-1$ and $1$ as $h \\to 0$, so the limit doesn't exist.\n",
